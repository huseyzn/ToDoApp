# ToDoApp
A UIKit-based todo application with Firebase integration for authentication and data synchronization.

## üö® Security Notice
This project includes Firebase configuration files for demonstration purposes only.
‚ö†Ô∏è This is NOT recommended for production applications because:

The Firebase API keys are publicly exposed
Anyone can access the database and authentication
There are no proper security restrictions
All Firebase costs will be charged to the project owner

This approach is used here solely for educational and testing purposes to allow easy setup and demonstration without requiring each user to create their own Firebase project.

## Features
User authentication (Sign up/Login)
Create, edit, and delete tasks
Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
Offline support with Core Data
Online sync with Firebase Firestore

## üõ† For Production Use
If you want to use this code in a real application:

Create your own Firebase project
Replace the GoogleService-Info.plist file
Configure proper Firestore security rules
Set up authentication properly
Remove the configuration files from version control

## Screenshots
Screenshots will be added soon
